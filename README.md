# The Challenge

This is a small code challenge used as part of our interview process.

You need to create a GitHub Viewer application where users can insert a specific repository and se information about it.

## Workflow:

- User type a repository
- The application shows up issues all issues related to that repository.
- User should be able to filter by all, open, closed or pull requests.

This is the same challenged implemented as a reference: https://github-viewer-zeta.vercel.app/

## Stack

We'd like to see this challenged implemented using this stack:

- Next.js using [Static Site Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) whenever possible
- TypeScript
- GraphQL with Apollo (This is the GitHub GraphQL API: https://developer.github.com/v4/)

You can change/improve the UI if you want.

## Bonus

If you find time, it'd be great to see this implemented:

- Unit tests using [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
- Be creative and surprise us, if you have a cool idea to implement go for it.

# What are we looking for?

We want to see how do you organize and structure your code int terms of reusability and maintainability.

God luck!
