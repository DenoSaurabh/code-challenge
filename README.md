# The Challenge

This is a small code challenge used as part of our interview process.

You need to create a GitHub Viewer application where users can insert a specific repository and se information about it.

## Workflow:

- User type a repository
- The application shows up issues open and closed as well as pull requests for that specific repository.

This is the same challenged implemented as a reference: https://github-viewer-zeta.vercel.app/

We'd like to see this challenged implemented using this stack:

- Next.js using Static Site Generation whenever possible
- TypeScript
- GraphQL with Apollo (This is the GitHub GraphQL API: https://developer.github.com/v4/)

You can improve the design if you want.

# Bonus

- Unit tests
- Emotion

# What are we looking for?

We want to see how do you organize and structure your code int terms of reusability and maintainability.

God luck!
